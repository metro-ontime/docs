# Initial.Website.Impressions-02.12
## Impressions

### Layout / Design
* “Nice Aesthetically”
* “Looks Fine”
* “Maybe a photo of the metro rail would make more sense”
*Test keeping the number/metrics above the fold*

### UX
* I cannot click on the lines themselves (Landing Page)
	- Even if I could, where would I be taken
* There is no About to see more info about what the site is for
* Networks and Stations do not take me anywhere
* If a line is selected, it is not clear that you have a line selected
	- Even if the color is GOLD

### Text
* “What is it that I am looking at?”
* “Be Clear that it is LA Metro Rail”
* I don’t know what network means by default


### Existing Features
* Hovering over the diagram, I do not know what the copy means
	- Left pane, what does the text mean?
* It is not clear that elements are clickable 

### New Features
* *Hide and show the Menu?*


## What is it now?

### Right now it is a stats page
* Is it possible to have everything exist on one page? 
	- All lines on the main page by default
	* The stats need to take center stage (above the fold)

### Order of importance
* Explanation (Temp Solution?)
* Stats (all trains) 
	- Filter
* Trip Visualizer 
* Map of the metro
