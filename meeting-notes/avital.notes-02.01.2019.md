# Hack for LA - Metro On Time
## Avital’s Questions
In their innovation group in their IT department
- They have worked with a lot of groups for Hackathons
- When they talked about rail info data (rail arrivals)
	- They had some reservations because they are currently working on something similar right now
	- What they need to work on is making the data itself better
- Real time arrival information is not particularly accurate
	- Isn’t accurate for a variety of reasons
	- Right now a few people are working on making this data better because it is a way they are talking to each other real time
	- It is also a priority of the mayor to improve it
* Thus, they did not think there would be a ton of data to use the data

### *She did pose question*
- If right now is not a good time to transform data to something new
	- If there another project they are working on that we could potentially help with
* On the bus side, with real-time arrival 
	* (50% of fleet has onboard data) so that every line is represented
	* they are also in the process of taking real time information and comparing with algorithm that is being created by Nextbus
		* They use some information to make assumptions (estimations), bus should arrive in one minute but it actually comes in 2 minutes
	* they are working on having the GPS devices on all busses soon

*Maybe it is time to work more on the algorithm that next bus is processing*
- including the information data stream
	- because they have a lot of busses out there currently 
	- so, there is enough to get actual travel speed of the busses (so some algorithm processing needs to be better defined)
		- some times stops are irregular, and the algorithms could be improved to help calculate
* they can share how we could potentially help
	* they are open (she thinks) in products around busses and bus travel
	* if we are interested we could set up a meeting with the manager they have on that side of the fence

### *Something also to think about*
- Within her office of extordenary innovation
- they put out a new challenge
- Think you can solve traffic
	- They are requesting proposals (concepts) on solutions
	- This closed as of yesterday
	- Go and check out the website metro.net/solvingtraffic

* Probably in the summer they would have a new idea
	* Around a topic of customer experience 
	* Probably going to be relearning something in May or June
	* They are looking for a proposal (5 slides)

*New York Metro just did a challenge*
- 2 different problem statements that were narrower in focus
	- They offered an implementation prize at the end of it
	* they might offer a cash prize
