While dev was working on a proof of concept we world through the following design/product background process

## Competitive Landscape
* What other tools are out there now? (other cities)
	- How do they present information?
	- What type of information do they present?
	- What do they and don’t they do well?
* What LA Metro data tools exist now?
	- How do they present information?
	- What might they be missing now?

## Domain Research
* Any LA Metro reports that exist now?
	- What information do they contain?
	- What gaps are they missing?
* What are people saying about LA Metro?
	- What published articles are there about the LA metro?
	- Have there been any policies or major adjustments to the LA metro recently?
	- What do LA Metro employees say and have to think?

## Personas
* Who do we think the main personas are now? (Riders/Policy Makers/LA Metro Employees)
	- What do they have in common?
	- What is different about them?
* How can we prove our assumptions? 
	- How can we narrow down metro riders quickly? (Screen metro riders to narrow our pool)
		- What can we do with this quantitative data? 
		- See how often riders ride the metro 
	- Create grouping of riders with similar survey answers
	- Understand basics of public’s issues with metro 
	- Gauge who is interested on further helping us
- How can we further build out rider groupings? (Chat/interview riders)
	- Understand their typical metro experience and ride
	- Uncover what technology they use to aide their metro experience and how
	- See what tools they are exposed to that show they charts and graphs about data
- What needs and problems do metro riders have?

## Solutions
* Using the personas and other research we have now, we began brainstorming solutions around the customers needs
	- Based on actual riders scenarios, problems and experience
	- *as a metro rider, I want ______ so that _______.* 
* With solutions in hard we prioritized solutions against each other
	- What can we quickly introduce to the MVP?
	- What has the largest impact for riders?
	- How does this solution compare to other products on the market?

## Designing
* Wireframe & prototype our solutions for development work
	- Collaboratively work on designs
	- User test with personas that we have vetted (screened)
	- Iterate on designs and retest
	- Annotate designs for developers
