# General Public // Metro Rider

How would any type of report system benefit metro riders?
- Allowing a persona the ability to see how the metro is performing
	- Journalist
	- News Outlets
- Data dump (visualizations) of how the train is doing overall (historically, into the future)
	- People interested in data

## Persona Creation (What we need to find out from metro riders)
- How many people actually use technology for train commuting?
- What are their key motivations of using technology when riding the metro?
- Is there anything missing from technology they use for the metro?
- What do they think of wait times while using the metro?

## Where could there be a need?
- Being able to look back in data and how things were in the past
	- Formulating reports and insights for public
	- Some people might be interested in looking at previous data to gauge future traveling decisions
- Comparison against Google Data to show how it might differ for future travel
	- How accurate is Google Data? - Per metro line/station // regions 
	- What's the cause?
- How busy is a train station? - How much Traffic?
	- Would there be a way to check/test this with current data?
	- How long are riders waiting at a train station?
- Time at station
	- The metro is at a station for a specific amount of time
- Infrastructure
	- Train was traveling between certain points quicker last week than this week (with no riders)
		- Is the train infrastructure in need of monitoring?
	- Elongated stops between certain lines / stations (Rest vs Emergency)
- Train Speeds
	- Is there any ways to make any inferences on what the speed is
	- Would this data be valuable?
- Train cars to train speed
	- With a certain number of cars per train how much slower is a train running the same line
- Train Age (How new is it?) - Model Number
	- What impact does it have?
- Trains per line
	- The total amount of trains on one line at a given time (what impact does it have?)
- How often are specific trains in use?
	- When are they swapped out?
	- How long are they at the end stations?
	- How often do they go in for maintenance?
	- When are they put out of their misery?
- The impact certain events have on the train timings
	- Sporting
	- Political
	- Marches
	- Music
